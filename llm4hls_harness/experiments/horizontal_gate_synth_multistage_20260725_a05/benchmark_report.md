# V3-D Batch Benchmark Report

- Benchmark fingerprint: `cde577d7af34987977feb4965190bc5bd1cc76b4110aae9a58ea9fd9390f0cef`
- Selected tasks / planned runs: `1 / 1`
- Latest slots / all attempts / new / resumed: `1 / 1 / 1 / 0`
- Stop reason: `COMPLETED`

> Evidence rule: DEMO and DETERMINISTIC rows are fixture evidence only. They are never included in the real-evidence headline below.

## Real Vitis evidence headline (all current-plan attempts)

> Retries remain in this population, so a later success cannot hide an earlier failed attempt. Latest-slot rows are used only for completion.

## Expected-mode diagnostics (all evidence populations)

> This table can mix fixture populations. It is diagnostic only; the REAL table above is the formal result.

| Mode | Runs | Success | Success rate | Patch rejections | Failure stages |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| OPTIMIZE | 0 | 0 | - | 0 | `{}` |
| REPAIR | 0 | 0 | - | 0 | `{}` |
| STRUCTURAL_FIX | 0 | 0 | - | 0 | `{}` |
| SYNTH_FIX | 0 | 0 | - | 0 | `{}` |

## Cross-run diagnostics (all evidence, kept separate above)

- Acceleration mean / median / count: `None / None / 0`
- Patch rejection rate: `-`
- Patch rejection reasons: `{}`
- Failure stages: `{"EXECUTOR":1}`

## Run IDs
